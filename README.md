## Description

Throughout the development process, I learned about a variety of concepts, including different ways of shooting projectiles, using state machines, and prefab variants.

One of my main goals with this project was to keep the code clean. I achieved this by decoupling the logic from the visuals, keeping the different parts of the game independent. This allowed me to reuse the code in different parts of the game, and also made it easier to add new features.
